# git hire! hire on üî•!

ever wondered who is coding what in your city and how to keep track of it, maybe `grep` projects by keyword?

this is your tool!

## Features

- [x] up to 1000 users per city + language combination (sorted by "users' public repositories count")
- [x] if less than 1000 users in a city total, you can download by location only
- [x] concurrency built-in üöÄ

## planned features

- [ ] get all users (not just 1000)
  - implement automatic bucketing, sliding through the limits
  - PROBLEM: GitHub sets the limit here ü•¥
- [ ] tests?! üßå
- [ ] sort by active last week? OR created in year?
- [x] speed isn't crucial, but utilizing some of `clojure.core.async` magic could speed things up 10x maybe :thinking: `pmap` ftw üéâ

## Prerequisities

- [babashka](https://www.babashka.org)
- GitHub API Token ([Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#using-personal-access-tokens))
- Java doesn't hurt, too

make sure your ENV has the `GITHUB_HIRE_TOKEN` at hand.  
I do it like this:  
in a terminal enter `$ export GITHUB_HIRE_TOKEN="<my-token-here>"`  
then, from that terminal open your IDE of choice, like  
`$ code .`

or have it in your `.zshrc` ü§ó or whatever your shell loads at start

ü•≥ happy times in the REPL

## Run

### Download profiles

`$ bb git-hire.clj <location-like-city-or-country>`  

Will save the github profiles as `.edn` into the `profiles` directory,  
**but** as GitHub support let me know:  
> When using the language qualifier when searching for users, it will only return users where the majority of their repositories use the specified language. (please, see [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-users#search-by-repository-language))

Specify further adding a language:

`$ bb git-hire.clj <location-like-city-or-country> <language>`

**Be warned!** This might not find a PHP dev who switched to Rust recently, as described by GitHub's Support.

Or if the city is too crowded, try loading mainstream languages for a given city.  
**Watch your rate limits ‚ö†Ô∏è**

After having built a pool of profiles, use  
`$ bb search-keyword "rust"` and/or see examples given below.

#### examples

`$ bb git-hire.clj mainz`  
`$ bb git-hire.clj "Bad Schwalbach"`  
`$ bb git-hire.clj wiesbaden java`  
`$ bb git-hire.clj wiesbaden php`  
`$ bb git-hire.clj mainz javascript`

### Search in result files (saved profiles)

`$ bb search-keyword <search term skill framework else>`

#### examples

`$ bb search-keyword android`  
`$ bb search-keyword "ruby on rails"`  
`$ bb search-keyword nuxt`

you might go further, by piping to bb again, unimaginable possibilities...

`$ mkdir rails; cp $(grep -Zril rails profiles) rails`

`$ bb search-keyword "ios" | bb -e '(map #(str/upper-case %) *input*)'`

### Inspect Profiles (with examples! ü§Ø)

`$ bb read-profile.clj simonneutert`

go further, by piping

`$ bb read-profile.clj simonneutert | bb -e '(:languages *input*)'`

read many profiles

```bash
$ bb search-keyword ruby | bb -e '(mapv #(edn/read-string (slurp %)) *input*)'
```

map out `name` and `bio`, where `bio` is provided

```
$ bb search-keyword ruby |\
    bb -e '(mapv #(edn/read-string (slurp %)) *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(mapv #(select-keys % [:name :bio]) *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(remove #(nil? (:bio %)) *input*)'
```

map out `name` and `bio`, where `bio` is provided, filter by bio containing "apple"


```bash
$ bb search-keyword ruby |\
    bb -e '(mapv #(edn/read-string (slurp %)) *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(mapv #(select-keys % [:name :bio]) *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(remove #(nil? (:bio %)) *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(filter #(clojure.string/includes? (clojure.string/lower-case (:bio %)) "apple") *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(clojure.pprint/pprint *input*)'
```

what you came here for üî• find all hireable

*search-keyword git* is sort of a hack returning all profiles you downloaded at this point

```bash
$ bb search-keyword git |\
    bb -e '(mapv #(edn/read-string (slurp %)) *input*)' |\
    bb -e '(remove #(nil? (:hireable %)) *input*)'
```

  "Accept":"application/vnd.github.v3+json"
```

```bash
# using httpie and jq

GITHUB_HIRE_LOCATION=wiesbaden;
https -A bearer -a ${GITHUB_HIRE_TOKEN} \
  "https://api.github.com/search/users?q=created%3A%3E${GITHUB_HIRE_SINCE_YEAR}-01-01+location%3A${GITHUB_HIRE_LOCATION}+repos%3A%3E1&type=Users" \

```


## FAQ

Some stuff you would want to know/read as a beginner.

### Errors

- REPL fails and outputs  
  `; : Can't set!: *current-length* from non-binding thread user `

`pmap` and `curl` don't play well with each other in the shell (I guess).  
Don't worry, run the tool from the shell:  
`bb git-hire.clj berlin ruby`  
it will fire up some threads üî•

### "github-username.edn" what am I supposed to do with that? JSON would be much nicer!

CLI to transform between JSON, EDN and Transit, powered with a minimal query language.

#### transform to JSON

```bash 
$ bb search-keyword ruby |\
    bb -e '(mapv #(edn/read-string (slurp %)) *input*)' |\
    jet --to json
```
